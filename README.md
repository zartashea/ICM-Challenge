# ICM-Challenge

For this solution, the Chatbot language that I selected is: Markdown
The two other markup languages I chose are HTML and JSON. In this code however I was able to convert HTML to MD only.
  
The solution contains a single file (python script) that will have the code to convert HTML to markdown. The file will also have test cases that will read from input files (also uploaded).

To test this, pypandoc will be reuqired.
